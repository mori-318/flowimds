[Japanese version](TODO_ja.md)

## Near-term priorities

- [x] Parallelize the processing pipeline to improve overall processing speed.
- [x] Add a logging flag that toggles progress bar output during execution. (Using callback functions)
- [x] Make semantic highlighting work.
- [x] Update the README and documentation.
- [ ] Set up a development environment with Docker containers.
- [ ] Implement a method to output pipeline results.
- [ ] Refine the run_on_paths workflow so paths are not configured twice (constructor vs. execution method).
- [ ] Speed up I/O via profiling.
- [ ] Provide a CLI entry point.
- [ ] Build the official website.
